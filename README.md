## Course Objectives

The goal of this course is to review common web security vulnerabilities and exploits, along with the defenses designed to counter them. We will explore the ongoing tension between the web as a "simple document reader" and the web as an "application environment". As the web ecosystem grows in functionality, so too do its vulnerabilities"

### What You’ll Learn
By the end of this course, you’ll understand the core principles of web security and how different attacks and defenses work. Topics include the browser security model, web application vulnerabilities, injection, denial-of-service, TLS attacks, privacy, fingerprinting, the same-origin policy, cross-site scripting, authentication, JavaScript security, emerging threats, defense-in-depth, writing secure code, web archiving, and rehosting.

You’ll also get hands-on experience with key technologies such as Git and GitHub, DOM and JavaScript, the command line interface (CLI), Node.js, and utilize platforms like X (Twitter) and YouTube.

Prerequisites: Unix/Linux, Web, HTML


## Course Inspiration

This course builds upon the foundation established by [Dr. Michael L. Nelson](http://www.cs.odu.edu/~mln/), who originally designed and previously taught the course. We will continue to benefit from his contributions by using the recorded video lectures and slides he developed as part of the weekly learning materials.  

The design and inspiration for this course also draw from **[CS 253: Web Security, Stanford, Fall 2019](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs253/)**. A special thanks to **[Feross Aboukhadijeh](https://feross.org/)** for generously sharing his course resources (though any mistakes remain my own).
