# Assignment 2 Submission

### Included Files/Packages

This assignment involves the use of express and cookie-parser in order to create a local server which uses cookies. [FavoriteServer.js](https://github.com/jaqui004/cs533-f25/tree/main/assignments/aquino/2/FavoriteServer.js) is used to initiate the server, and [index.html](https://github.com/jaqui004/cs533-f25/tree/main/assignments/aquino/2/index.html) is the html file which functions as the server homepage. The files [DarkestDungeon.html](https://github.com/jaqui004/cs533-f25/tree/main/assignments/aquino/2/DarkestDungeon.html), [MarriageDAmour.html](https://github.com/jaqui004/cs533-f25/tree/main/assignments/aquino/2/MarriageDAmour.html), [ChickenParmesan.html](https://github.com/jaqui004/cs533-f25/tree/main/assignments/aquino/2/ChickenParmesan.html), and [TheGame.html](https://github.com/jaqui004/cs533-f25/tree/main/assignments/aquino/2/TheGame.html) are the html files used by the various paths which can be visited on the server.


### Server Functionality

The server operates on local host 4000, and the home page lists four paths, each of which corresponds to a favorite: 
  * A [favorite game](https://github.com/jaqui004/cs533-f25/tree/main/assignments/aquino/2/DarkestDungeon.html)
  * A [favorite song](https://github.com/jaqui004/cs533-f25/tree/main/assignments/aquino/2/MarriageDAmour.html)
  * A [favorite meal](https://github.com/jaqui004/cs533-f25/tree/main/assignments/aquino/2/ChickenParmesan.html)
  * A [favorite dated joke](https://github.com/jaqui004/cs533-f25/tree/main/assignments/aquino/2/TheGame.html). 
  
  Each path links to an html file with a simple explanation as to why it is a favorite. When each is visited, a cookie is created which denotes that the user has visited the path it is associated with.
