        <!--Links and References-->

        <!--Link are the basis of hypertext documents. To create one, you must provide the address. The anchor tag <a> is used to provide 
        a link, with the href attribute supplying the URL/URL fragment. For example:
        <a href="https://google.com/">Google</a>
        There are other attribtes such as download (instructs browsers to download a URL instead of navigating to it) and target (specifies
        where to display the linked URL). Images can also be placed inside of the link, to create a clickable image.-->
