        <!--Styles and Scripts-->

        <!--Web pages can be stylized using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and can be included using the <style> tag. Styles can also
        be linked to using the <link> tag, with important attributes like 'href' (URL) and 'rel' (names a relationship of the linked document to
        the current document). It's best to include styles in the <head> element. JavaScript can also be included in an HTML document using
        the <script> tag. It has attributes such as 'src' (specifies the URI of an external script), 'type' (identifies the scripting language), 
        'async' (a boolean which indicates if the browser should execute this asynchronously), 'defer' (a boolean which indicates if a script should 
        be executed after the document is parsed). It's best to inlcude scripts before the closing of the <body> element-->

        

        <script>
            console.log('This is from an inline script')
        </script>
