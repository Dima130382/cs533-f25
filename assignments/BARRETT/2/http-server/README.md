Set up and run a server on your local machine
Install four "paths" on your server, with each path corresponds to four of your favorites â€” a personality (like an internet personality, artist, or musician), a place to visit, a song or book, and a movie or TV series. For example, my paths might be:
localhost:4000/taylorswift
localhost:4000/big-sur.html
localhost:4000/born-a-crime
localhost:4000/a-silent-voice.html
For each path, have a sentence or two in HTML that explains why this is a favorite of yours
For each path, set a cookie that echos the corresponding favorite of yours (make up a syntax for your key-value pair, but keep the cookies human-readable)
