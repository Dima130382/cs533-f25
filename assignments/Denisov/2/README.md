# CS 433/533 — Assignment 2 (Denisov)

## Overview
Node.js Express server with 4 routes. Each route displays one of my favorites and sets a human-readable cookie using `cookie-parser`.

**Favorites used:**
- Person: **Jim Kerry** — “He is fun and positive. I think our world is missing some good sense of humor nowadays.”
- Place: **Grand Canyon** — “I’ve always dreamed of visiting it. Feels like another planet. Gorgeous and supernatural.”
- Book: **Harry Potter series** — “I thought fairytales are for kids only. I started to read HP to my daughter… She said: ‘That’s OK.’ But I am still reading.”
- Movie: **The Matrix series** — “I just like that movie. Let’s follow the white rabbit.”

## How to run
```bash
npm install express cookie-parser
node server.js
